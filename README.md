# IVR-system-for-movie-Ticket-Booking

Movie is considered the worldâ€™s all over by  many as a important art form. 
Movies entertain,educate ,enlighten and inspire audiences. The visual elements of cinema need no translation,giving the motion picture of communication.
Increasing demand of movies ticket booking and no proper functioning by manual humans causes a lot of inconvenience so we are introducing an IVR System(Interactive voice response system).
The problems faced in the present scenario can be solved  by the deployement of an interactive voice response system to automate the  ticket booking for movies and other shows . 
This can replace labor-intensive manual activities. The new system can streamline and standardize the ticket process at a substantial cost savings.
